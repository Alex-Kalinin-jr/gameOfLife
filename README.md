#DESCRIPTION
This is an implementation of the game being very popular in the past (who knows - knows).
- The field is defined in header file (WIDTH HEIGHT), you can change it if want.
- Start images are in "txt" files (you can create your own if want).
- you must give ***RELATIVE*** file path when you are asked it.
- Despite the program uses minimum of standard libraries (except my own little example of static lib) this program  ***IS NOT INTENDED*** for platforms other than UnixLike.
- Despite of rules this version does not end when image is cyclic or the same as previous. There are 100 iterations in the loop. To increase/decrease num of iterations just rewrite loop condition.

#NOTE
This project is not intended for any purposes other than showing of my style code and undestarding standard algorithms. Just for fun xD.
